                Habit Tracker is a major project of mine focusing on implementing my skills on the VILT stack
                and testing new-found knowledge in AWS. This project is something that came from a small idea,
                with input from friends into a publicly available app ready for use.

                Habit Tracker allows you to track and remind you
                of habits or even just general things that occur regularly. You can create habits that
                will repeat on a given schedule you give; weekly (One day of each week), Daily (Multiple days of the
                week)
                or monthly (Once a month occurrence). With that you are given a week view of all your habits to help
                focus your concentration, but for a more broad overlook you can use the calendar to view habits for
                the month.
                Including filtering of the habits based on type and completion status.
