            This site started out pretty basic, with a couple pages and not much to show. Over the past year it has
            really come to life with improved UI,
            updated information and now a fully integrated blog system.

            The Blog system is something that I am proud of and allows me to reflect on experiences throughout my
            career. The blog management
            system is built in a Vue/Inertia environment utilising the <a href="https://github.com/SethSharp/BlogCrud"

                sethsharp/blog-crud </a> composer package. It has a fully integrated TipTap editor allowing me to to do
            virtually everything I need with my content - with a custom image upload system I can integrate images to
            help improve my
            content, SEO columns to help push my content and tags/collections to help narrow & group the content I post.
