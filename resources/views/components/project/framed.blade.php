                    "Framed Just For You" marked a significant milestone in my career as it was my first
                    client-developer
                    project. The journey began with the decommissioning of the original site at the end of November
                    2023 and I was appointed the responsibility to create and manage the next one.

                        The process involved a step-by-step approach to conceptualize the vision for the site â€” a more
                        modern
                        design that effectively showcased the range of services offered by Framed Just For You.
                        Since
                        the
                        site was previously managed by another company, effective communication was crucial in
                        facilitating
                        the transfer of ownership of the domain.

                        After gaining control of the account, I transferred it to a GoDaddy account, chosen for its
                        streamlined and efficient services. Subsequently, I set up a Route53 with AWS and obtained
                        an
                        SSL
                        certificate via ACM to ensure a seamless transition without any downtime for the original
                        site.
