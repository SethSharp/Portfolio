                WIL (Work Integrated learning), is a program Griffith University runs, that allow
                students to attend Work Placement in companies partnered with the uni. For myself,
                it ran over 1 trimester (12 week program) at Coding Labs. Codings Labs is a Software
                Development Agency base din Burleigh heads.

                    The start of the placement focused on learning the tech stack that Coding Labs uses. We completed
                    their boot camp course based around the Laravel framework, which included front-end development with
                    components, templates, and routing. Through to using the integrated database design system Eloquent
                    that can setup models and relationships. While learning this we were designing our portfolio page as
                    we learned new skills and concepts within Laravel. The other half of the placement was working on an
                    internal project which got us to work on all the content that we had learned while working with
                    other interns.

                    From this placement I have learned new insights into how a project starts and the early stages of it
                    work. From the internal project, the basic idea was developed, on what the game would achieve,
                    target audience and how that might affect the requirements. Then we decided on the proof of concept,
                    which is something new to me, but something that I always considered with my own projects.

                    Another experience from this placement was integrating my current knowledge and skill sets into a
                    new environment. Previously I have had experience in the web development area, in JS frameworks and
                    non-relational database. This placement introduced me to a PHP framework and a relationship
                    database, which are both very different but similar knowledge areas. I found a lot of things to be
                    like my current knowledge area but was different in the way certain parts would communicate and the
                    different ways to setup certain components.

                    With learning a new tech stack, I found myself in a familiar environment, but also a challenging
                    one. As I had to continuously learn and research what certain components did and how to integrate
                    them. This experience is something that I enjoy as learning new things I find very helpful in
                    increasing my problem-solving skills as well as my knowledge area. The value of this is great, not
                    only do I get to add a new knowledge area to my profile but can show that I can learn and
                    confidently implement this new knowledge. In todayâ€™s tech market, new technology and concepts are
                    constantly being created and introduced into software development agencies, with this experience I
                    can prove that although I may not have the specific knowledge area, I have the skill set to learn
                    the tech easily and be able to apply my skill set to it and excel.

                    Working on the internal project with others has shown me a lot with what to expect and how to
                    prepare for future career in similar agencies. As I start my career in this industry this experience
                    is of high value and brings a lot to my portfolio. This experience has shown me how to integrate
                    myself into an internal project, by working and taking advantage of the features of a source control
                    system such as Git to maintain and develop large projects. As well as learning how to collaborate
                    and distribute tasks among other workers to achieve the end goal. With future opportunities early
                    into my career, I will be able to apply what I have learned and quickly integrate myself into a
                    team. As well as this, learning the new tech stack has been a high value experience, with both my
                    future career and in other areas. Being able to apply existing skills and knowledge into a new
                    environment can be applied everywhere, not just in the tech world, by training my-self to problem
                    solve in every case by applying what I know to different circumstances.

                    From this experience I was hoping to achieve multiple goals. Real industry experience, learning from
                    experience developers and other interns, applying my existing knowledge, test my problem-solving
                    skills and understand how to work/collaborate in a group. These goals all contribute to my chosen
                    major in Bachelor of Computer science software development.

                <p class="sm:w-3/5">
                    The first half of the placement took us through their internal Bootcamp course, which introduced us
                    to the main tech stack that they use for developing projects. This time allowed us to create our own
                    portfolio site and a few smaller projects implementing the content and concepts that we learned. The
                    second half of the placement introduced us to a planned internal project that we would be working
                    on. This experience allowed us interns to work and collaborate with each other as well as
                    experienced developers. This experience introduced us to how to start and setup any project they
                    would work on. During the placement I think I could have gotten involved more in discussions that
                    involved other interns, instead I would be working on my own tasks. One a couple occasions I could
                    have joined in a bit more just for a bit of extra involvement and possible pick something new up.

                    From these experiences the outcomes are both expected and new. I was able to work and collaborate in
                    groups and learn how to work on a group project using Git. Although I have been introduced to
                    software engineering and getting requirements together for a project, this placement was a new
                    experience in how to do that. From this, I now have experience and a better understanding of how
                    these processes work. Which I can now apply to future opportunities as I enter the software
                    development industry. Learning the new technology also provided a set of expected new outcomes.
                    Based on my previous experience in learning a new framework I was familiar with a lot of the
                    concepts; it was just a structure difference in the code and syntax changes. There were also some
                    new outcomes which were features specific to this new framework. To improve these results in the
                    future I think is just continuing to be involved and trying in contributing to group discussions.
                    This would continue to improve my collaboration skills.

                    This experience helped me understand the process of developing and managing a project as a group.
                    Have an insight into the views and beliefs of a software development agency. Further increasing my
                    skill set in programming. As well as my problem-solving skills. If I were to take this placement
                    again, I would continue to problem solve and learn things on my own, but when it comes to a problem,
                    I cannot solve I will ask for help. I would also still put in effort in my discussion and overall
                    attitude towards projects. One aspect which I would try to do differently, or more improve on, is
                    asking for feedback more often. Instead of smashing out a task, get feedback throughout the process
                    to ensure Iâ€™m on the right track.

                    Throughout the past 2 years of studying, I have been consistently working part-time at Dominos as a
                    Delivery driver. Among this I have worked a handful of managing shifts and involve myself in
                    customer service. I worked at Gladstone dominos for about 1 year before moving to the Gold Coast
                    where I now still work at Dominos. Working here created multiple friendships that last to this day
                    and continue to make. Originally when I first applied and got the job, all I was hoping for was a
                    decent pay check and something to do (I love to work). But as I continued to work I found an
                    opportunity in it, where I can learn and further develop, in my teamwork and communication skills.

                    My role as delivery driver involves a lot of customer service as well as in store serving customers.
                    During these situations I paid more attention on how I was communicating with them. Especially when
                    I must handle people who are cranky and in general hard to deal with. I thought if I can talk about
                    the problem that they were having and able to effectively explain the situation I would increase my
                    skills in handling more intense conversations and topics on short notice. As well as communication
                    skills, teamwork was always a part of the job. Over time I learnt to build better friendships and
                    help create a more optimistic and fun work environment for everyone.

                    Over time I got better at communicating with customers as well as handling complaints. I also
                    noticed that as I tried more in creating friendships at work, the environment did become a more fun
                    and exciting environment for everyone. From this I learnt how to build friendships in short amounts
                    of time and become a lot better in communicating in tense situations and just on a casual basis.
                    This can apply to my future career in Software Development. From my experience at Coding Labs, I was
                    able to apply my teamwork and communication skills in a different field and learn how important they
                    are in this field of work.
