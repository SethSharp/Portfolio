                From 2020 to the beginning of 2024, I studied and successfully completed a <b> Bachelor of Computer
                    Science </b>
                degree with <b> Griffith University </b> on the Gold Coast. Graduating with a overall GPA of <b>
                    5.44 </b>, majoring in <b> Software Development </b>. This course took me over the fundamentals of
                programming including
                algorithms, data structures, AI and introductions to different software development life cycles.

                </b>
                for a work placement opportunity during the second trimester of the 2023 year. I got introduced to
                the Laravel framework as well as the TALL stack. From this I was given an opportunity in <b> November of
                    2022 </b> to become a
                <b> Graduate Software Developer</b>, which I gratefully accepted. Since then, I have been working on
                some
                awesome projects and learning heaps of new technology, programming concepts and collaborating in a team.
